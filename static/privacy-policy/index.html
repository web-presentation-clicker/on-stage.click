            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <b>Last Updated: November 7th, 2024</b>

            <p>To facilitate a painless user experience, our browser extension connects to a server. The limitations of the information collected by this transaction is the same as when your browser connects to any other website.</p>
            <p>We value your privacy, and only collect information to prevent abuse of our services and gauge user activity. We do not share any personal information with any third-parties.</p>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Web Presentation Clicker extension ("we", "our", or "us") and covers our collection, use, and disclosure of your information. This Policy does not cover any third-party websites, services, or applications that can be accessed through our app, or third-party services you may access through the use of the Web Presentation Clicker extension.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Stored Data: When the Web Presentation Clicker extension connects to our servers to start a session, a unique session identifier is randomly generated. This identifier is stored both within the browser extension and on our servers. The identifier is used to forward the requested actions (such as "next slide" or "previous slide") from your mobile device to your browser. The session identifier is also used when reconnecting to the server if the connection is temporarily lost during the course of the presentation session. After the session expires, the unique identifier is no longer valid, and a new one will be generated the next time a presentation session is started.</li>

                <li>IP Address and User Agent: Like with any website, your device's IP address and User Agent string are sent to our servers when a presentation session is started. This information is kept for not more than 30 days, and is only used to combat abusive connections to our service.</li>

                <li>Usage Information: Along with your device's IP address and User Agent string, any actions you perform are also sent to our servers. This includes, but is not limited to: "next slide", "previous slide", and a heartbeat to indicate that the presentation session is still active. This information is also kept for not more than 30 days, and is primarily used to combat abusive connections to our service. In addition, however, this information may be aggregated from all users in the form of a counter, because "big number looks cool". For more information see the Big Number section below.</li>

                <li>Big Number: We aggregate usage data across all users in the form of one or more "big numbers". These aggregated figures may be shared publicly for the purposes of looking cool. This aggregated data is anonymized by nature, and cannot be linked to individual users. Before sharing these numbers, we will take precautions to ensure it cannot be used to track any active usage. As such, a precise live count of this number will not be published, as such a live count could be used to identify the start and end of sessions. This aggregated count will not be sold; nor would we pursue such an option if it were available.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Preventing Abuse: We may use your device's IP address and User Agent to help us block abusive connections. Additionally, we may also correlate this information with session identifiers generated for your IP address. This tells us how many sessions were opened from your device's IP Address, when they were opened, what events (such as "next slide" and "previous slide") were sent, and for how long the session lasted.</li>

                <li>Limited Sharing: We don't share the data we collect except when aggregated as outlined in the "Big Number" section. The sole exception would be if we're legally required to hand over the data, such as in the case of a lawful request by public authorities. So if the NSA really wants to know when you clicked "next slide", I'm sorry.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data Security: We're committed to safeguarding your information. While no system is 100% secure, we take various measures to protect information about you from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction.</li>

                <li>Encryption: We protect your information with SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmitted between the Web Presentation Clicker extension and our servers via HTTPS and WSS, ensuring your data is secure in transit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Due to the anonymous nature of the data we collect, we cannot directly associate any stored data with specific individuals. As such, we are unable to fulfill requests for access, deletion, or correction of individual data records. However, we periodically delete data to ensure minimal retention.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. It's encouraged that users frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.</p>

            <h3>N3VR $ELL CLAUSE</h3>
            <p>This clause hereby declares that neither this, nor any future iterations of this privacy policy may include any clause promoting the sale of your personal information. Additionally, this clause may not be removed from any future iterations of this privacy policy. WITHOUT EXCEPTION.</p>
